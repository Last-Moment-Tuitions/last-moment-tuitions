# Last Moment Tuitions (LMT) Platform 🎓

A modern, high-performance educational platform built with **Next.js 14**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. This monorepo houses both the frontend application and the backend API, designed for seamless serverless deployment.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The project is split into two distinct workspaces:

1.  **`frontend/`** (Next.js 14 App Router)
    *   **User Facing**: Fast, SEO-optimized pages for students.
    *   **Admin Panel**: A rich CMS for managing content, templates, and analytics.
    *   **Tech**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, GrapesJS (Page Builder).
    *   **Port**: `3000`

2.  **`backend/`** (Express.js)
    *   **API Layer**: Handles all logic (`/api/*`), Database connections, and CRUD operations.
    *   **Database**: MongoDB (Page content, User data, Analytics).
    *   **Port**: `3005` (Proxied by Next.js in dev)

## ✨ Key Features

### 📂 File Manager System
We've replaced the traditional flat list of pages with a powerful **File Manager**:
*   **Folders**: Organize content into unlimited nested categories (e.g., `Engineering > Sem 1 > Maths`).
*   **Breadcrumbs**: Easy navigation through the hierarchy.
*   **Grid View**: Visual cards for folders and pages, distinct from a dry table.

### 🎨 Global Templates System
No more copy-pasting headers!
*   **Reference-Based Templates**: Create a Master Template (like `Global Header`).
*   **Live Updates**: Editing the Master Template instantly updates **every page** that uses it.
*   **Default Layout**: New pages are automatically seeded with a **Sticky Header** and **Footer** by default.

### 📝 Visual Page Builder
Integrated **GrapesJS** editor tailored for LMT:
*   **Drag & Drop**: Build complex layouts without code.
*   **Custom Blocks**: Pre-built sections (Hero, Features, Pricing) matching the brand design.
*   **Live Preview**: See exactly how your page will look before publishing.

### 📊 Built-in Analytics
*   **View Tracking**: Every page view is recorded.
*   **SEO Health**: Visual indicators (Green/Yellow/Red dots) show if a page is SEO-ready (Title, Description, etc.).
*   **Dashboard**: High-level stats on growth and performance.
